# Substance Alchemist to Unity URP
For whatever reason Substance Alchemist (2.2.1) only ships with a Unity HDRP export setting and not a URP setting. It also has no way of creating an export setting without using Substance Designer - which I have done for you.

## Installing.
Substance Alchemist only lets you edit export presets when you're exporting an actual material. Once you've gotten to the export window, under Presets, select import presets and navigate to the `Unity-URP.sbsar` file. There will now be a preset called Unity URP.

### This currently only works for Metallic workflows. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
